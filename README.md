# FAQ

**What is the point of the RST?**
  The RST may seem valueless to outside viewers who do not have to teach new members the same thing over and over. However, the RST allows the region to allow new members to easily calculate their nation population without any hard effort.
  
**You stated this is hosted somewhere?**
  It is hosted on the Audaxian Regional Forums which can be found here: http://s15.zetaboards.com/Audaxia/pages/reditumsystem/
  
**RST seems pretty undeveloped?**
  It is not fully finished as it's in alpha. Due to other projects, it is one of the lesser-projects deemed by the Audaxio staff.

**May I use RST for my nationstates region?**
  Yes, you may.
